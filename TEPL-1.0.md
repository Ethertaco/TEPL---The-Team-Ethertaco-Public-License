## Preamble  
The Team Ethertaco Public License (TEPL) is a free, open-source, copyleft license designed to ensure collaborative development while protecting creators' rights. This license was originally developed for Team Ethertaco projects but is available for adoption by any individual or organization.  

TEPL prioritizes community reciprocity - derivative works must grant the same freedoms to users, particularly in network service contexts. It explicitly distinguishes between freedom to use (libre) and zero-cost distribution (gratis), while establishing clear boundaries for commercial applications.
