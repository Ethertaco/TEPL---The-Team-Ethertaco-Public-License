> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Critical Update: TEPL Version 1.4 is the New Recommended Version**
>
> We have released **TEPL Version 1.4**, which now supersedes all previous versions and becomes the current stable and recommended license.
>
> **Please read carefully:** TEPL 1.4 builds upon the significant legal and governance enhancements introduced in prior versions. It refines the "Commercial Use" definition by introducing the "Copyright Steward" concept and a clearer contact point for licensing inquiries (Section 1.8), and further strengthens patent protection for non-commercial users with a new "Patent Retaliation" clause (Section 2.6). These updates provide greater clarity and security for all users.
>
> For a detailed list of all changes, please see our **[HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md)** file.
>
> **All new and existing projects are strongly encouraged to use [TEPL Version 1.4](TEPL-1.4.md).** Previous versions (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.0, 1.3.1) are now considered deprecated and are retained for historical reference only.

## Welcome to the Team Ethertaco Public License Repository

This repository hosts the official text and ongoing development of the Team Ethertaco Public License (TEPL) family.

The TEPL is a **source-available, strong copyleft license** designed to protect community-driven and personal projects from commercial exploitation, while ensuring that all modifications and distributions give back to the community under the same terms.

**Disclaimer**: The TEPL is not approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). It is intended for authors who wish to share their work with a strong emphasis on non-commercial use.

## Which Version to Use?

We recommend using the latest stable version for all your projects. Currently, this is **[TEPL Version 1.4](TEPL-1.4.md)**.

### Future Development

Team Ethertaco is continuously working to refine and strengthen the TEPL family of licenses. Future versions will aim to further enhance governance structures, legal robustness, and clarify usage scenarios. We appreciate feedback as we develop these future versions. Stay tuned for updates!

## Using TEPL in Your Project

If you choose to license your work under TEPL, you should include the full license text (e.g., `TEPL-1.4.md`) in your project's root directory and add a license header to each source file.

### TEPL 1.4 License Header Template

Here is a recommended header template for your source code files (e.g., for Java):

```java
/*

```

**Note:** As per TEPL 1.4, the "Copyright Steward" is the central authority. Ensure the contact for the Copyright Steward (currently `license@ethertaco.cn`) is accurate and up-to-date in your project's documentation. The `AUTHORS.md` file is still a good practice to acknowledge contributors, but the authority for "Verified Authorization" and "Reinstatement" now explicitly rests with the **Copyright Steward**.
