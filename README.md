> **Critical Update: TEPL Version 1.5 is the New Recommended Version**
>
> We have released **TEPL Version 1.5**, which now supersedes all previous versions and becomes the current stable and recommended license.
>
> **Please read carefully:** TEPL 1.5 further strengthens community reciprocity and clarifies its application. Key updates include:
> *   **Extended Evaluation Period:** The 90-day internal evaluation period for for-profit organizations can now be extended up to 180 days with a written technical justification.
> *   **Copyright Steward Dormancy:** New provisions define the dormancy of the Copyright Steward's authority if unresponsive for 180 days, with succession rules to be documented in `ADMIN.md`.
> *   **GPLv2 Incompatibility:** Explicitly clarifies that TEPL 1.5 is not compatible with GNU GPLv2.
> *   **AGPLv3 Reversion (Conditional):** Introduces a narrow, conditional path for projects combined with AGPLv3 to potentially revert to TEPL, requiring unanimous Steward consent.
>
> For a detailed list of all changes, please see our **[HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md)** file.
>
> **All new and existing projects are strongly encouraged to use [TEPL Version 1.5](TEPL-1.5.md).** Previous versions (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.0, 1.3.1, 1.4) are now considered deprecated and are retained for historical reference only.

## Welcome to the Team Ethertaco Public License Repository

This repository hosts the official text and ongoing development of the Team Ethertaco Public License (TEPL) family.

The TEPL is a **source-available, strong copyleft license** designed to protect community-driven and personal projects from commercial exploitation, while ensuring that all modifications and distributions give back to the community under the same terms.

**Disclaimer**: The TEPL is not approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). It is intended for authors who wish to share their work with a strong emphasis on non-commercial use.

## Which Version to Use?

We recommend using the latest stable version for all your projects. Currently, this is **[TEPL Version 1.5](TEPL-1.5.md)**.

### Future Development

Team Ethertaco is continuously working to refine and strengthen the TEPL family of licenses. Future versions will aim to further enhance governance structures, legal robustness, and clarify usage scenarios. We appreciate feedback as we develop these future versions. Stay tuned for updates!

## Using TEPL in Your Project

If you choose to license your work under TEPL, you should include the full license text (e.g., `TEPL-1.5.md`) in your project's root directory and add a license header to each source file.

### TEPL 1.5 License Header Template

Here is a recommended header template for your source code files (e.g., for Java):
