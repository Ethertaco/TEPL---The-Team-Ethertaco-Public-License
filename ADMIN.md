# Team Ethertaco Public License (TEPL) Copyright Steward Administration and Succession Policy

This document outlines the policy and procedures for the administration and succession of the **Copyright Steward** role for projects licensed under the Team Ethertaco Public License (TEPL), as required by **TEPL Version 1.5, Section 1.8**.

Its purpose is to ensure the long-term stability, legal clarity, and continued adherence to the non-commercial principles of the TEPL ecosystem, even in unforeseen circumstances regarding the current Steward.

---

## 1. Current Copyright Steward

As designated in TEPL Version 1.5, the current Copyright Steward is **Team Ethertaco & QinShenYu**.

**Official Contact for Licensing Inquiries:** `license@ethertaco.cn`

---

## 2. Responsibilities of the Copyright Steward

The Copyright Steward, in its capacity as the sole authority for administering the TEPL, is responsible for, but not limited to:

*   Administering the TEPL and ensuring its consistent application.
*   Considering and granting "Verified Authorizations" for Commercial Use.
*   Considering and granting "Reinstatements" of rights after termination.
*   Providing interpretations of TEPL clauses (e.g., via non-binding informational guides).

All actions by the Copyright Steward shall be consistent with the TEPL's Preamble and its stated non-commercial public commons principles.

---

## 3. Trigger for Succession (Dormancy)

As per TEPL Version 1.5, Section 1.8, if the Copyright Steward becomes unresponsive to **all official licensing inquiries** (directed to the official contact email `license@ethertaco.cn`) for a consecutive period of **180 days**, its authority to grant new Verified Authorizations and Reinstatements is considered **dormant**.

*   **Determination of Unresponsiveness:** Unresponsiveness will be determined by the absence of any official reply or acknowledgment to multiple good-faith inquiries sent to the official contact email over the 180-day period. Public project activity (e.g., code commits, forum posts by individual members of the Steward entity) does not preclude a determination of unresponsiveness to *licensing inquiries*.
*   **Effect of Dormancy:** During dormancy, the Steward cannot grant new Verified Authorizations or Reinstatements. Existing licenses remain valid, but the system's ability to issue new commercial grants or cure violations is suspended.

## 4. Succession Process for a Dormant Steward

Upon a determination that the Copyright Steward's authority is dormant (as defined in Section 3), a successor Steward may be designated according to the following procedure:

1.  **Candidate Identification:**
    *   The project's top 5 non-corporate contributors over the preceding 24 months shall be identified. This determination will be based on objective, verifiable metrics from the project's primary source code repository history (e.g., number of merged pull requests, lines of code contributed, significant issue resolutions).
    *   The definition of "non-corporate contributor" aims to identify individuals who have contributed primarily in a personal capacity, without direct commercial conflict of interest regarding the TEPL's non-commercial principles.
2.  **Consensus Seeking:**
    *   These identified top 5 contributors will attempt to reach a **verifiable consensus** (e.g., a unanimous public agreement documented in a publicly accessible forum or repository issue) to designate a new individual or entity as the successor Copyright Steward.
    *   The consensus-seeking period should not exceed 60 days from the date of dormancy determination. If no consensus is reached, the dormant state persists.
3.  **Public Declaration:**
    *   Once a successor is designated by consensus, the newly designated Steward must make a **public declaration** (e.g., via the official project website, GitHub repository, and/or mailing list) announcing their assumption of the Steward role and confirming the full reinstatement of authority.
4.  **Effective Date:**
    *   The succession becomes effective immediately upon this public declaration. The successor Steward fully assumes all responsibilities and authorities outlined in TEPL Version 1.5.

---

## 5. Reinstatement of Authority

The authority of the Copyright Steward (whether the original Steward after dormancy, or a newly designated successor) is reinstated upon a public declaration by a designated successor Steward as described in Section 4. From that point, the designated successor becomes the active Copyright Steward.

---

## 6. Guiding Principles for Succession and Stewardship

Any successor Steward shall operate in strict adherence to the principles articulated in the Preamble of TEPL Version 1.5, specifically fostering a non-commercial public commons. The succession process aims for transparency, fairness, and the continued best interests of the TEPL community.

---

## 7. Document Maintenance

This `ADMIN.md` document is maintained by the active Copyright Steward. Any modifications to this policy must be publicly announced and subjected to a community review period (e.g., 30 days) before taking effect, to ensure broad community awareness and consensus, consistent with the spirit of the TEPL.
