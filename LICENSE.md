## Team Ethertaco Public License (TEPL) Version 1.4

**Effective Date: August 21, 2025**

**Official Source Repository: https://github.com/Ethertaco/LICENSE**

---

### Preamble

The Team Ethertaco Public License (TEPL) is a free, source-available, strong copyleft license. It is designed to ensure collaborative development and community reciprocity while establishing clear boundaries for its application.

This license is founded on the principle that the Software should be freely available for public inspection, academic use, personal projects, and non-commercial collaboration. To maintain this principle, TEPL intentionally establishes a high barrier for commercial application. It achieves this by generally prohibiting Commercial Use and by creating a strong presumption against the sale of separate commercial licenses, thereby steering the project towards community-based support and non-profit models of sustainability.

**Disclaimer**: This license is not approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). It is a "source-available" license intended for the specific needs of its authors. Users are responsible for their own legal compliance when using software under this license.

### 1. Definitions

#### 1.1. "Software"
The original copyrighted work licensed under this License, including all source code, object code, documentation, configuration files, and associated resources distributed with the original work.

#### 1.2. "Modification"
Any alteration, addition, or deletion to the Software's structure, functionality, or behavior, including the creation of derivative works based on the Software.

#### 1.3. "Distribute"
To transfer a copy of the Software or a Modification to a third party, or to make its functionality accessible to a third party, including through network services (SaaS, PaaS, etc.).

#### 1.4. "Commercial Use"
Any application of the Software or a Modification is considered "Commercial Use" if it is used in a product or service that generates revenue (including from sales, subscriptions, advertising, or service fees), AND where the Software or Modification is integral to that product or service's core functionality.

**Safe Harbor Clarifications**: For the avoidance of doubt, the following uses are always considered Commercial Use under this license:
- Providing the Software's functionality as a subscription-based service (SaaS).
- Selling a physical or virtual product where the Software is the core operating system or engine.
- Providing paid professional services (such as support, consulting, or integration) where the Software is a central component of the service delivered.
- Using the Software as a core instructional or practical tool in a for-profit educational program, such as a paid online course or commercial training bootcamp.

**The "Integral Test"**: A component is considered "integral" if either of the following is true:
a) The primary reason a user pays for or uses the product or service is due to functionality provided by the Software or Modification.
b) Removing the Software or Modification would render the product or service non-functional, deprive it of a primary feature for which users choose it, or otherwise render it unmarketable.

**Explicitly Excluded from Commercial Use**:
- Receiving voluntary sponsorships or donations with no grant of exclusive features or services;
- Use of the Software for evaluation, academic research, or personal learning in a non-production environment;
- Use within a for-profit organization for internal testing or development for a period not exceeding 90 days, for the sole purpose of evaluating whether to seek a Verified Authorization.
- Personal, non-monetized projects.

#### 1.5. "Sponsorship"
Financial contributions given voluntarily for general project support, without any contractual expectation of services, features, or preferential treatment in return.

#### 1.6. "Verified Authorization"
A separate, legally binding, written agreement executed between the **Copyright Steward** and a third party, which grants that third party specific permissions for Commercial Use that are not granted by this License.

#### 1.7. "Corresponding Source"
The complete and preferred form of the source code required to generate, install, and run the object code version of the Software or a Modification.

#### 1.8. "Copyright Steward"
The legal entity or group of individuals designated in the Copyright Notice of this license. The Copyright Steward is the sole authority for administering this license, including granting Verified Authorizations and Reinstatements. All official correspondence must be directed to the contact address specified in the Copyright Notice or a successor address publicly designated by the Steward.

### 2. Permissions and Conditions

#### 2.1. Grant of Rights for Non-Commercial Use
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each recipient is granted a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to:
a) Use and run the Software for any non-Commercial Use;
b) Study and analyze the Software's source code;
c) Create Modifications of the Software for any non-Commercial Use;
d) Distribute the Software and its Modifications, provided such distribution is for non-Commercial Use and complies fully with Section 2.3.

#### 2.2. Restriction on Commercial Use
Commercial Use of the Software is prohibited under the terms of this License. This license grants no rights for Commercial Use. While the Copyright Steward retains the inherent right to grant a Verified Authorization, this license establishes a strong philosophical and procedural presumption against such actions.

#### 2.3. Conditions for Distribution
If you Distribute the Software or any Modification, you must fulfill all of the following conditions:
a) You must provide the complete Corresponding Source to all recipients, under the terms of this License.
b) You must preserve all original copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices.
c) You must conspicuously document all of your Modifications in a reasonable, machine-readable format.
d) You must include a complete, unmodified copy of this License with the distribution.

#### 2.4. License Compatibility and Integration
a) **With Strong Copyleft Licenses**: If you combine the Software with a work licensed under the GNU AGPLv3, the resulting combined work may, at your option, be governed entirely by the terms of the GNU AGPLv3.
   *Note on AGPLv3 Compatibility*: This clause is intentionally provided as a one-way bridge. It allows a project under this License, at the discretion of its contributors, a path to migrate into the broader, OSI-approved AGPLv3 ecosystem if its original non-commercial goals are no longer applicable or desirable. This action is irreversible for the combined work.
b) **With Permissive Licenses**: If you incorporate components licensed under permissive licenses (such as MIT or Apache 2.0), the obligations of this License apply to the combined work as a whole. This does not change the license of the original, standalone permissive-licensed components.

#### 2.5. Grant of Patent License for Non-Commercial Use
Each contributor grants you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, and otherwise transfer the Software, but **only for non-Commercial Use**. This patent license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such contributor that are necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone or by combination of their contribution(s) with the Software.

#### 2.6. Patent Retaliation
If you institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Software or a Modification constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to you under this License for that Software shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### 3. Legal Provisions

#### 3.1. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
This license is governed by the laws of Hong Kong SAR. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this License shall be resolved according to the following procedure:
1. A 30-day period of good-faith negotiation between the parties.
2. If negotiation fails, mediation administered by the WIPO Mediation and Arbitration Center.
3. If mediation fails, binding arbitration in Hong Kong under the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules.

*Note on Jurisdiction*: Hong Kong SAR was chosen as the governing jurisdiction due to its mature, bilingual (English and Chinese) common law system and its status as a globally recognized center for international arbitration, providing a neutral and predictable legal framework.

#### 3.2. Resolution of Ambiguity
In any dispute over the interpretation of terms such as "integral" or "core functionality" as used in Section 1.4, interpretation shall be guided by the intent described in the Preamble and the "Integral Test". In cases of genuine uncertainty, a presumption in favor of a "non-commercial" classification shall apply.

#### 3.3. User's Responsibility for Compliance
You, the user, are solely responsible for determining whether your use of the Software complies with the terms of this License, including the "Commercial Use" restrictions. The choice of governing law in Hong Kong SAR does not exempt you from compliance with your local laws. Relying on this Software for any purpose is at your own risk.

#### 3.4. Language and Translations
The English version of this License is the only official, legally binding version. Unofficial translations may be created and distributed to help users understand the License, but they have no legal effect.

### 4. Termination

#### 4.1. Automatic Termination
Your rights under this License will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms. Specifically, any attempt at Commercial Use without a separate Verified Authorization, or any Distribution that fails to provide the Corresponding Source, will result in immediate termination of your rights.

#### 4.2. Reinstatement
If your rights are terminated under Section 4.1, they are not automatically reinstated. You may request reinstatement from the **Copyright Steward** in writing. Reinstatement may be granted at the sole discretion of the **Copyright Steward** after they have verified that the violation has been fully cured.

### 5. Warranty and Liability

#### 5.1. No Warranty
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

#### 5.2. Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
